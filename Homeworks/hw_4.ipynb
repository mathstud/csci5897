    "* Ted Turner paid for a prevalence study to be done. A team of researchers went out into the field at night dressed in bison disguises, and subjected 1000 bison to tickling — a decent way to see if they have hiccups. Only 7 had hiccups. \n",
    "* The estate of Buffalo Bill paid for a seroprevalence study to be done. They took blood samples from 1000 randomly chosen bison and found that 517 had  BRUH antibodies."
